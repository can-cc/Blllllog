#+TITLE: Elisp 定时器

在 emacs 插件开发中，调用定时器是比较常见，elisp 的定时器比较有点意思，所以分享一下。

elisp 中的 timer 分为两种，一种是普通的 timer，一种是空闲 timer，第二种的用处比较少，因为第二种是在 emacs 空闲的时候才开始计算，不是很准。

两种 timer 的创建函数分别是

/Command: run-at-time time repeat function &rest args/
#+begin_src lisp
;; Command: run-with-idle-timer secs repeat function &rest args

;; example 
(defvar my-resume-timer nil
  "Timer for `my-timer-function' to reschedule itself, or nil.")

(defun my-timer-function ()
  ;; If the user types a command while my-resume-timer
  ;; is active, the next time this function is called from
  ;; its main idle timer, deactivate my-resume-timer.
  (when my-resume-timer
    (cancel-timer my-resume-timer))
  ...do the work for a while...
  (when taking-a-break
    (setq my-resume-timer
          (run-with-idle-timer
            ;; Compute an idle time break-length
            ;; more than the current value.
            (time-add (current-idle-time)
                      (seconds-to-time break-length))
            nil
            'my-timer-function))))
#+end_src

/Command: run-at-time time repeat function &rest args/
#+begin_src lisp
;; Command: run-at-time time repeat function &rest args

;; example 
(setq my-timer-store (run-at-time "1 min" 900 'my-func))
#+end_src


两者的取消函数都是

#+begin_src lisp
(cancel-timer 'function)
#+end_src

之前我用 timer 撸了一个定时提示休息眼睛的 elisp 插件，不像其他软件那么烦，强制你休息，关掉屏幕，因为程序员都知道，打断自己的编码是十分令人厌烦的，贴一下核心代码部分

#+begin_src lisp
